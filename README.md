# COAL-Catch-Alphabets
This is an assembly language program (for INTEL 8088, ran and tested using DOSBOX) that generates random alphabets and allows user to use arrow keys to move a box at the end of screen and catch the alphabets. The game ends when user misses 10 alphabets in total. This code is combined effort of me and a friend. Use any notepad app to view the code.
